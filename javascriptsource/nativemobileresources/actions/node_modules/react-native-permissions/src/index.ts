if (NativeModules.RNPermissions == null) {
  throw new Error(`react-native-permissions: NativeModule.RNPermissions is null. To fix this issue try these steps:
• If you are using CocoaPods on iOS, run \`pod install\` in the \`ios\` directory and then clean, rebuild and re-run the app. You may also need to re-open Xcode to get the new pods.
• If you are getting this error while unit testing you need to mock the native module. You can use this to get started: https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-permissions/blob/master/mock.js
If none of these fix the issue, please open an issue on the Github repository: https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-permissions`);
