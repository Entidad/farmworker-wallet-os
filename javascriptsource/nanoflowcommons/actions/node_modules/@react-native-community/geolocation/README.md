The Geolocation API extends the [Geolocation web spec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation).

Currently, on Android, this uses the [android.location API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/package-summary). This API is not recommended by Google because it is less accurate and slower than the recommended [Google Location Services API](https://developer.android.com/training/location/). This is something that we want to change in the near future https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-geolocation/issues/6.

In order to use the new [Google Location Services API](https://developer.android.com/training/location/) with React Native, please check out alternative libraries:

- [react-native-geolocation-service](https://github.com/Agontuk/react-native-geolocation-service)
- [react-native-location](https://github.com/timfpark/react-native-location)

  <h3>Projects with Native Code Only</h3>
  <p>
    This section only applies to projects made with <code>react-native init</code>

### iOS

You need to include `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` and `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` in `Info.plist` to enable geolocation when using the app. If your app supports iOS 10 and earlier, the `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` key is also required. If these keys are not present in the `Info.plist`, authorization requests fail immediately and silently. Geolocation is enabled by default when you create a project with `react-native init`.

In order to enable geolocation in the background, you need to include the 'NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription' key in Info.plist and add location as a background mode in the 'Capabilities' tab in Xcode.

## Migrating from the core `react-native` module
This module was created when the Geolocation was split out from the core of React Native. As a browser polyfill, this API was available through the `navigator.geolocation` global - you didn't need to import it. To migrate to this module you need to follow the installation instructions above and change following code:

```javascript
navigator.geolocation.setRNConfiguration(config);
```

to:

```javascript
import Geolocation from '@react-native-community/geolocation';

Geolocation.setRNConfiguration(config);
```

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you need to have geolocation API aligned with the browser (cross-platform apps), or want to support backward compatibility, please consider adding following lines at the root level, for example at the top of your App.js file (only for [react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform-specific-code.html#native-specific-extensions-ie-sharing-code-with-nodejs-and-web)):

### Details

#### `setRNConfiguration()`

<<<<<<< HEAD
Sets configuration options that will be used in all location requests.


```ts
Geolocation.setRNConfiguration(
  config: {
    skipPermissionRequests: boolean;
    authorizationLevel?: 'always' | 'whenInUse' | 'auto';
    enableBackgroundLocationUpdates?: boolean;
    locationProvider?: 'playServices' | 'android' | 'auto';
  }
) => void
```

Supported options:

* `skipPermissionRequests` (boolean) - Defaults to `false`. If `true`, you must request permissions before using Geolocation APIs.
* `authorizationLevel` (string, iOS-only) - Either `"whenInUse"`, `"always"`, or `"auto"`. Changes whether the user will be asked to give "always" or "when in use" location services permission. Any other value or `auto` will use the default behaviour, where the permission level is based on the contents of your `Info.plist`.
* `enableBackgroundLocationUpdates` (boolean, iOS-only) - When using `skipPermissionRequests`, toggle wether to automatically enableBackgroundLocationUpdates. Defaults to true.
* `locationProvider` (string, Android-only) - Either `"playServices"`, `"android"`, or `"auto"`.  Determines wether to use `Google’s Location Services API` or `Android’s Location API`. The `"auto"` mode defaults to `android`, and falls back to Android's Location API if play services aren't available.
=======
```javascript
geolocation.setRNConfiguration(config);
```

Sets configuration options that will be used in all location requests.

**Parameters:**

| Name   | Type   | Required | Description |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | ----------- |
| config | object | Yes      | See below.  |

Supported options:

* `skipPermissionRequests` (boolean, iOS-only) - Defaults to `false`. If `true`, you must request permissions before using Geolocation APIs.
* `authorizationLevel` (string, iOS-only) - Either `"whenInUse"`, `"always"`, or `"auto"`. Changes the whether the user will be asked to give "always" or "when in use" location services permission. Any other value or `auto` will use the default behaviour, where the permission level is based on the contents of your `Info.plist`.
>>>>>>> aec85746435d3ba41358c5b7d65f93f87448e5b8

        POSITION_UNAVAILABLE: number;
        TIMEOUT: number;
      }
    ) => void
  )
```

On iOS if NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription is set, it will request Always authorization, although if NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription is set, it will request InUse authorization.
=======
```javascript
geolocation.requestAuthorization();
```

Request suitable Location permission based on the key configured on pList. If NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription is set, it will request Always authorization, although if NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription is set, it will request InUse authorization.

        timeout?: number;
        maximumAge?: number;
        enableHighAccuracy?: boolean;
    }
  )
```


Supported options:

* `timeout` (ms) - Is a positive value representing the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) the device is allowed to take in order to return a position. Defaults to 10 minutes.
=======
```javascript
geolocation.getCurrentPosition(geo_success, [geo_error], [geo_options]);
```

Invokes the success callback once with the latest location info.

**Parameters:**

| Name        | Type     | Required | Description                               |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |

>>>>>>> aec85746435d3ba41358c5b7d65f93f87448e5b8
* `maximumAge` (ms) - Is a positive value indicating the maximum age in milliseconds of a possible cached position that is acceptable to return. If set to 0, it means that the device cannot use a cached position and must attempt to retrieve the real current position. If set to Infinity the device will always return a cached position regardless of its age. Defaults to INFINITY.
* `enableHighAccuracy` (bool) - Is a boolean representing if to use GPS or not. If set to true, a GPS position will be requested. If set to false, a WIFI location will be requested.

---

#### `watchPosition()`

      maximumAge?: number;
      enableHighAccuracy?: boolean;
      distanceFilter?: number;
      useSignificantChanges?: boolean;
    }
  ) => number
```

Supported options:

* `interval` (ms) -- (Android only) The rate in milliseconds at which your app prefers to receive location updates. Note that the location updates may be somewhat faster or slower than this rate to optimize for battery usage, or there may be no updates at all (if the device has no connectivity, for example).
* `fastestInterval` (ms) -- (Android only) The fastest rate in milliseconds at which your app can handle location updates. Unless your app benefits from receiving updates more quickly than the rate specified in `interval`, you don't need to set it.
* `timeout` (ms) - Is a positive value representing the maximum length of time (in milliseconds) the device is allowed to take in order to return a position. Defaults to 10 minutes.
=======
```javascript
geolocation.watchPosition(success, [error], [options]);
